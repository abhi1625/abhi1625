    title: "Panorama stitching using Traditional Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches"
    authors: "Abhinav Modi, Kartik Madhira and Prateek Arora"
    note: "In this project we have used Homography to warp multiple images and stitch a panorama using three different techniques- Traditional  approach  using  feature  matching  and  RANSAC, Supervised  approach  to  predict  a  4  point  parametrization of  Homography  between  two  images  and  an  Unsupervised approach  to  predict Homography from the 4pt parametrization without  the  presence  of a  ground  truth."
