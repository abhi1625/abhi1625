    title: "Forward and Inverse Kinematic Modelling of a Mobile Manipulator Robot: WALLE"
    authors: "Abhinav Modi"
    note: "The main idea of this project was to model the Kinematics of a reduced DOF(Degree of Freedom) model of the robot: WALL-E from the original Disney PIXAR movie: WALL-E. The objective is to perform a pick and lift operation using both the arms together on a mobile base. This will enable the robot to pick a box full of supplies, kept at fixed distance which is more than one arms reach."
