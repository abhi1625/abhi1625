    title: "AR Tag detection and tracking, to project a 3D Cube in a video sequence"
    authors: "Abhinav Modi, Kamakshi Jain and Rohan Singh"
    note: "Blob detection is used to detect three encoded(ID and orientation) tags which is followed by the use of homography and then perspective warping to project a cube on each tag based on its ID and orientation."
