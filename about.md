Hey! I'm a Graduate Student pursuing Masters of Engineering in Robotics in the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a> (UMD). I am a member of the <a href="zz">Perception and Robotics Group</a> (PRG),  advised by <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~yiannis/">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a> and <a href="http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~fer/">Dr. Cornelia Fermuller</a>. PRG is associated with the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu">University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies
</a> (UMIACS) and <a href="http://arclab.isr.umd.edu/">Autonomy, Robotics and Cognition Lab</a> (ARC). My interests are in application of control systems and vision-based navigation of aerial and mobile robots.

Prior to joining UMD, I did my Bachelors of Engineering(Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering at  <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a>. At BITS, I worked in the  <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/centreforrobotics/CRISLab">Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems Lab </a> (CRIS) and was advised by <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rout/profile">Prof. Bijoy Kumar Rout</a>. I was also a member of the Formula Student Team at BITS Pilani: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/inspiredkarters/?view_public_for=109794559106727">Inspired Karters</a>
